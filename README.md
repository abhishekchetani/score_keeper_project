# 🏓 Ping Pong Score Keeper

A simple and responsive **Ping Pong Score Keeper** app built using **HTML**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and styled with the **Bulma CSS framework**. This app allows 2 players to compete in a game of ping pong and keeps track of the score, declares the winner, and offers a reset button to start over.

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Dynamic score tracking for two players
- 🏆 Highlights the winner and disables further play
- 🧼 Reset button to start a new game anytime
- 🎯 Choose winning score using a dropdown
- 📱 Responsive UI using Bulma (flexbox-based)

## 🛠 How It Works

- Each player has a button to increment their score.
- The game ends once a player reaches the selected winning score.
- The winning player's score turns green, the losing player's red.
- A reset button clears all scores and enables buttons again.
- You can change the winning score anytime — the game resets automatically.
