# score_keeper_project

A Score Keeper for Ping Pong using JavaScript & a new Bulma framework for styling of the document, based on Flexbox. Game highlights the player that wins after a game & a reset button is provided to start over.

Also, few potential changes to enhance it further:
1) Add win by 2 feature which is the actual Ping Pong game otherwise its just Badminton
2) Add functionality for entering Player Names
3) Add even more players in the game, not in Ping Pong but just to experiment using Rest params essentially.
4) Add an animation in the document when a player wins.
5) Add functionality for keeping a Tally of all the matches in the game.
6) Add keyboard controls for keeping score & resetting the game.
